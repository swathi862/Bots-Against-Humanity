Bots Against Humanity is a card game application that closely resembles the game 'Cards Against Humanity', except that instead of human players, this app uses three automated players or little robots to submit answer cards in response to a randomly generated question card.

I designed this game to be a fun way to entertain yourself while maintaining the unique brand of humor when you can't visit your friends and have a game night together.


## How to Start the App

1. Either fork this repository to create your own local repository or clone it down to run it. 

## Login/Register

![alt text](https://github.com/swathi862/Bots-Against-Humanity/blob/master/Screenshots/black-text-logo.png "Login/Register page")

When the user starts the app, the first page they will see is the login/register page prompting them to press one of the two buttons.

+ If the user has already registered for an account and is returning to the app, they can select the login button, which will take them to a page where they will prompted for their email and password.

+ If they are a first time user, they should register for an account, which will direct them to a page prompting them for a username, email, and password.


## Home

![alt text](https://github.com/swathi862/Bots-Against-Humanity/blob/master/Screenshots/black-text-logo.png "Home page")

This is the page where a user can create a trip using an interactive map, generate trip details- trip mileage, duration, and approximate gas cost, personalize the trip with a name and description, and add the trip to their personal **My Trips** page.

#### Collect Points
There are tools available on the interactive map to make planning the trip you'd like to go on much easier. 
1. On the vertical control panel, located on the left side of the map, you'll find a zoom in feature (+) and a zoom out feature (-), which will allow you to zoom in and zoom out on the map to present a view detailing more specific landmarks or cities in order to see exact places you'd like to visit.
The control panel also contains a 'Reset North'(won't change map view) and a 'Geolocate' feature- the last button on the panel-which will lets the map locate your current location.
+ You may also use the touchpad to zoom in and out on the map. And you can drag the map around to look at different areas by holding down the left touchpad button.
2. On the top right side of the map, you'll find a search bar that takes in input like addresses, cities, or zip codes and returns some results that best match your search text. Once you click on a result, it maps that location on the map for you to further explore. You cannot search coordinates on this search bar- it utilizes reverse geocoding.
3. You'll find the map markers needed to plot a trip pinned in the center of the United States map. 
+ _Green Marker_- This is the primary marker that you should move around to pinpoint your destinations. ONLY MOVE THIS MARKER AROUND for best results. You need to move this marker at least 2 times ot generate any trip details.
+ _Red Marker_- This marker is merely a placeholder to specify the destination the green marker was previously at.

#### Visit the Store
This section is located to the right side of the **Plan** page, beside the map, containing the trip details which will be generated after moving the map marker at least twice to create a trip with a start and end point, as well as, the ability to save the trip to your personal **My Trips** page.
+ The fields that take in user input include _Name_(to give the trip a name) and _Destination_(provides a description of the trip, which can include the start and end points, a list of activities, who you're planning on going on the trip with, when, etc.).
+ The fields generated by moving the markers around are _Mileage_- approximate distance in miles from point A(red marker) to point B(green marker), _Estimated Time_- total approximate driving, and _Estimated Cost_- estimated gas cost. 
        
+ The **_Save Trip_** button allows you to save your trip to your **My Trips** page, where you'll gain more functionality with what all you can do with your trip.

## How to Play


The **Explore** page functions as community databse of all of the completed trips that users have voluntarily shared with a rating and review for other adventurers to view and take inspiration from. A user can find trips utilizing the search bar and select a trip view the trip's details and the rating and review left by the user who shared the trip to the page. 


+ By clicking on the **_Details_** button on a trip, you can open up a modal that will list the trip name at the top followed by the trip destination, mileage, estimated travel time, and estimated travel cost. The modal will also include a rating out of 5 stars and a review submitted by the user who created the trip.
+ By clicking on the **_Save to 'My Trips'_** button on the _Details_ modal, you can add this trip to your **My Trips** page, specifically under the _Future Trips_ tab.

## How to Purchase Decks

This page saves all the trips the user has selected. The page has two tabs- a _Future Trips_ tab and a _Completed Trips_ tab. All the trips you add to this page will be under the _Future Trips_ tab.
